# Description

At Helping Hands, we believe in the power of community and the warmth that comes from helping one another. We are a non-profit organization dedicated to connecting families and individuals with the resources they need, all over the country. Whether it's finding food, a warm meal, or housing support, we work closely with churches, community centers, and other local organizations to lend a helping hand. This Thanksgiving week, we are especially focused on making sure every family has access to the support and resources they need. Our goal is simple: to give back and bring our community closer together by ensuring no one goes without the essentials during this special time of year. Together, we can make a difference.
